# NBA-Lite

Created an NBA roleplaying game which allows for users to verse various NBA players of increasing skill level. Once the user defeats a certain
player, they get an additional amount of gold but then they are forced to make a choice: either they can buy additional moves to eventually 
fight the boss or they can buy back the health they lost in the fight. Once the user has gathered up enough moves the user will then be able 
to take on the final boss. This project was made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
